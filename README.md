## Future of Work / SaaS 

I'm an ex-enterprise business director now founder and consultant who obsesses about work dignity and its intersection with technology. I find the most joy in managing creatives and engineers by bridging out-of-the-box thinking with business objectives. I know because I'm a creator myself as a full stack developer, jaded music producer, and homebrewer.
