## Future of Work / SaaS 

I'm an ex-enterprise business director now founder and consultant who obsesses about the dignity of work and its intersection with technology. I find the most joy in managing creatives and engineers by bridging out-of-the-box thinking with business objectives. I know because I'm a creator myself as a full stack developer, jaded music producer, and homebrewer. 

## What I do

### [Yallhands](https://yallhands.com) (founder)
Making it simple for any business leader to better their workplace knowledge, communications, and culture.

### [Aleia](https://www.aleia.io/) (partner)
Walk with non-technical business leaders and founders to help launch wounderful apps, products, and websites.
