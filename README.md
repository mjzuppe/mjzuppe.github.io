## Leadership and Product for Web3/SaaS/e-Commerce
### Boston / NYC

I'm an ex-enterprise content director turned founder and consultant. I'm a generalist who can double as a CMO or a CTO, making sense when you discover that I find the most joy in [managing creatives](https://yallhands.com/blog/crushing-the-myth-that-creatives-require-delicate-management) and engineers by bridging rapid iteration and validation processes with business objectives. Translating concepts and initiatives are easy for me being a creator as a **full stack developer**, multi-instrumentalist and jaded music producer, and homebrewer. 

## What I do
Lean, and impactful business and product development for web3 and web2.

Specializing in blockchain, content strategy, SEO, CMS, web applications, technology stacks, data architecture, software product lifecycle, and microservices.

## What have I worked on
